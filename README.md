# Mushroom-Classification
Classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous by training on different supervised machine learning algorithms. I have used Support Vector Machine with kernels Linear, Polynomial and RBF. Also, Decision Trees and Boosting to analyze the performance of different models on the data set.
