# Mushroom-Classification
Classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous by training on different supervised machine learning algorithms. I have used Support Vector Machine with kernels Linear, Polynomial and RBF. Also, Decision Trees and Boosting to analyze the performance of different models on the data set. An overview of the type of work executed is shown below. For details, please read the report file.

# Linear SVM Class seperation
The seperation achieved between data points is visually shown

# Decision tree Performance
Using both entropy and information gain as the metric, the performance is measured kepping pruning in mind

# Performance Across the models
Complete comparison of models giving best performances is recorded and plotted for visual clearity
